    "# Species-tree & species-delimitation using *bpp* (BP&P) or *ibpp*\n",
    "The program *bpp* by Rannala & Yang (2010; 2015) is useful for inferring species tree parameters and testing species delimitation hypotheses. Is it *relatively* easy to use, and best of all, it's *quite fast*, although not highly parallelizable. This notebook describes a relatively streamlined approach we've developed to easily setup input files for testing different hypthotheses in *bpp*, and to do so in a clear programmatic way. We also show how to submit many separate jobs to run in parallel. This approacgalso works with the program *ibpp*, which allow integration of traits with sequence data. \n",

This is a Jupyter notebook which contains documented code, in this case all Python, that can be used to replicate an analysis. The purpose of these notebooks is to produce a reproducible document that is easy to share, reproduce, and/or use as supplemental materials, by simply uploading it to a site such as github. "

I show an example of this below, using a function from the ipyrad API [**loci2bpp()**] that we've created for this purpose. This will create all of the dependency files for a bpp analysis. The first is the IMAP file (*.bpp.imap.txt*), which simply maps sample names to species groups. The second is the sequence file (*.bpp.seq.txt*), which obviously contains the sequence data, properly formatted. And the third is the *.bpp.ctl.txt* file, which contains parameters for the bpp analysis. A final optional 'traits' file can also be produced for ibpp analyses. \n",

For example, you can keep only loci that have at least N samples in each species, and it removes any sample from the data set that is not listed in your IMAP dictionary. You can also set all of the ctl parameters here. We'll start by creating an IMAP dictionary that matches 'species' names to lists of sample names belonging to each species. "

And Rannala and Yang suggest that you try out both species delimitation algorithms and that you do so over a range of params for the two algorithms. They suggest that you run algorithm 0 with $\\epsilon$=(2, 5, 10, 20), and algorithm 1 with $\\alpha$=(1, 1.5, 2) and $m$=(1, 1.5, 2). And also to do this with different starting trees.
