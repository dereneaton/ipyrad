Try ipyrad now in the cloud
===========================

You can easily try ipyrad without even having to install it by connecting to an interactive jupyter notebook running in the cloud: `binder link <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dereneaton/ipyrad/master?filepath=newdocs%2FAPI-analysis>`__. 

This service only provides access to a single computing core, so ipyrad will obviously run much slower than on a larger workstation or server. 
But this example is sufficient to explore the ipyrad Python API for 
assembly and data analysis.
