    "# Eaton & Ree (2013) single-end RAD data set\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we demonstrate a denovo assembly for an empirical RAD data set using the ipyrad Python API. This example was run on a workstation with 20 cores and takes about 10 minutes to assemble, but you should be able to run it on a 4-core laptop in ~30-60 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our example data we will use the 13 taxa *Pedicularis* data set from [Eaton and Ree (2013) (Open Access)](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/62/5/689/1684460/Inferring-Phylogeny-and-Introgression-using-RADseq). This data set is composed of single-end 75bp reads from a RAD-seq library prepared with the PstI enzyme. The data set also serves as an example for several of our [analysis cookbooks](http://ipyrad.readthedocs.io/analysis.html) that demonstrate methods for analyzing RAD-seq data files. At the end of this notebook there are also several examples of how to use the ipyrad analysis tools to run downstream analyses in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the ingroup taxa from this study and their sampling locations. The study includes all species within a small monophyletic clade of *Pedicularis*, including multiple individuals from 5 species and several subspecies, as well as an outgroup species. The sampling essentially spans from population-level variation where species boundaries are unclear, to higher-level divergence where species boundaries are quite distinct. This is a common scale at which RAD-seq data are often very useful.  \n",
